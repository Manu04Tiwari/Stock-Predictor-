# Stock-Predictor-
This is a project which predicts the stock price with an accuracy of 80% using the historical data of that particular company
# Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning in Python
Machine learning has revolutionized various industries by automating tasks that previously required human labor. One such application is predicting whether a particular stock trade will be profitable or not. In this project, weâ€™ll explore how to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques.
# Libraries Used:
# Pandas:
For handling data frames and performing analysis tasks.
# Numpy:
Efficient array computations.
# Scikit-learn (Sklearn):
Pre-implemented functions for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
# Conclusion
By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project aims to help investors make informed decisions and potentially improve their returns on investment. Predicting stock prices is a challenging task, but with the right techniques, we can gain valuable insights into market trends.
